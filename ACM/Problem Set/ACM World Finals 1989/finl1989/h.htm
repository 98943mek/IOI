<P>
A PGA (Professional Golf Association) Tour event is a
golf tournament in which prize money is awarded to the best
players.  The tournament is broken into four rounds
of 18 holes apiece.  All players are eligible to play the first two
rounds.  Only those with the best scores from
those 36 holes ``make the first cut&quot; to play the final two rounds and
qualify for prize money.  Players with the
best 72-hole aggregate scores (the lowest scores) earn prize money.
<P>
<P>
You must write a program to determine how the total
prize money (called the tournament ``purse&quot;) is to be allocated
for a tournament.  Specifications are as follows.
<P>
<DL COMPACT><DT><STRONG>1)</STRONG>
<DD> All players will play at least two 18-hole rounds
     (36 holes in all) unless they are disqualified for some
     reason.
<DT><STRONG>2)</STRONG>
<DD> Any player who is disqualified stops playing at the
     time of the disqualification. Players who are disqualified
     during the first two rounds are ineligible to make the cut.
     Players who are disqualified during either of the
     last two rounds are ineligible to win prize money.
<DT><STRONG>3)</STRONG>
<DD> At the end of the first two rounds, the field of
     players is cut to the 70 players with the lowest 36-hole scores
     plus ties.  So if 10 players are tied for 70th place,
     then 79 players make the 36-hole cut.  Players who do not
     make the 36-hole cut are eliminated from the
     playing field and do not win any prize money.
<DT><STRONG>4)</STRONG>
<DD> The players who do make the 36-hole cut play an
     additional 36 holes (two 18-hole rounds) and are paid a
     percentage of the total prize money depending
     on their 72-hole aggregate score.  The lower the score, the
     more prize money a player wins.
<DT><STRONG>5)</STRONG>
<DD> Players are paid percentages of the the tournament
     purse according to their final standings. For example, if
     the tournament purse were $1,000,000 and the
     winner's share were 18%, the winner would earn $180,000.
<DT><STRONG>6)</STRONG>
<DD> There will be only one winner of this tournament.
     (In an actual golf tournament, when there is a tie for the
     low 72-hole score, there is be a play-off among
     the tied players.  We will ignore that situation.)
<DT><STRONG>7)</STRONG>
<DD> There may be a tie for any or all of the positions
     between 2 and 70. If there is a tie among <I>n</I> players for
     position <I>k</I>, the money designated for positions <I>k</I>
     through <I>n</I> + <I>k</I> - 1 is pooled and allocated
     equally among the
     tied players.  For example, using the sample data
     given later, if there were a tie for second place between
     two golfers, they would each win $88,000
     [(10.8% + 6.8%)/2 = 8.8% * $1,000,000].  If there were a
     three-way tie, all three golfers would get $74,666.66
     [(10.8% + 6.8% + 4.8%)/3 = 7.4666% * $1,000,000].  The
     extra penny is ignored.
<DT><STRONG>8)</STRONG>
<DD> If disqualification reduces the field to less
     than 70 players, the money for the last and any other places not
     covered is not allocated.  For example, if
     exactly 70 players make the cut but three of them are disqualified,
     then the tournament simply pays 67 places.
<DT><STRONG>9)</STRONG>
<DD> Amateur golfers may play in professional
     tournaments but can win no money. Any prize money ``won&quot; by
     an amateur is allocated to the next lower position.
     For example, if an amateur has placed third in a
     tournament, then third place money goes to the
     fourth place finisher, and fourth place money goes to the
     fifth place finisher, etc.
<DT><STRONG>10)</STRONG>
<DD> Only the low 70 non-amateur places and ties
     earn prize money. For example, if 75 players make the 36-hole cut,
     it is possible for 5 of them not
     to earn prize money, assuming none of the players making the cut
     are amateurs.

<P>
<!-- FIXED: changed the description to support multiple tournaments -->
The input contains multiple tournaments. There's line with number of
players attending the tournament (always less than 145) and then follow
two segments of data of the tournament. Zero players denotes end of
input file.
<!-- END OF FIXED -->
The amount
of the tournament purse and the percentages for all the 70
places are stored in the first segment of the input file.
This segment contains exactly 71 lines, which are formatted
as follows.
<P>
<PRE><TT> 
 Line 1: 	 Total value of the purse
 Line 2: 	 Percentage of the purse designated for first place
 Line 3: 	 Percentage of the purse designated for second place
 ...
 Line71: 	 Percentage of the purse designated for 70<I>th</I> place
</TT></PRE>
<P>
<!-- FIXED: removed the note, because users are encouraged to use
 integers and not reals:
All entries in the first 71 file lines can be read as real numbers. -->
<!-- FIXED: added note about purse formatting -->
The purse is given to two decimal places.
All percentages are given to four decimal places.
Assume the percentages are correct and sum to 100%.
<!-- FIXED: added following that allows use of integers -->
No tournament has purse bigger than $40 millions.
A partial sample of the first segment of the input file is shown
below.

The second segment
<!-- FIXED: removed following set of words:
 of the input file -->
 contains
the players' names and their respective scores for the four rounds.
The format of each line is as follows.
<!-- FIXED: reworked input format -->
<P>
<PRE><TT> 
 Characters 1-20:  Player name
 Character  21:    Single space      
 Characters 22-24: Round 1 score (first 18 holes)
 Character  25:    Single space
 Characters 26-28: Round 2 score (second 18 holes)
 Character  29:    Single space
 Characters 30-32: Round 3 score (third 18 holes)
 Character  33:    Single space
 Characters 34-36: Round 4 score (fourth 18 holes)
</TT></PRE>
<P>
Any player who has an asterisk `*'
<!-- FIXED: changed the amateur flag from:
 at the end of his last name -->
as the last non-space character in name column
 is an amateur.  All players who are not disqualified
will have four 18-hole scores listed.
(Even though in an actual tournament,
players who do not make the cut do not
get to play the last two rounds of the
tournament, for the purposes of this program all players who are not
disqualified will have four 18-hole scores listed.)
A player who is disqualified during a round will have a score on
that round shown as `<TT>DQ</TT>'.  That player will
have no additional scores for the tournament.  Assume that at least 70
players will make the 36-hole cut.
<!-- FIXED: removed this useless note:
The end of input is denoted by end-of-file. -->

Sample lines from the second segment of the input file are as follows.

<P>
Output from this program consists of names of all
players who made the 36-hole cut, their finish positions (with the
letter ``<TT>T</TT>&quot; after the numeric value representing
the finish position if there is a tie for that position
<!-- FIXED: added exact order of ties -->
, write the players with tie in the order they were in input set
), scores for each
round, total scores, and the amounts of money won.
Disqualified players are listed at the bottom with scores of <TT>DQ</TT>
placed in the ``<TT>TOTAL</TT>&quot; column;
<!-- FIXED: order of the disqualified changed from:
 the order among disqualified players is unimportant. -->
those disqualified should be written in the order they appeared in input
set.
  No player who failed to make
the 36-hole cut is listed in the output.
Each column of output should be formatted and labelled appropriately.  The
dollar amounts should be correct to two decimal places.
<!-- FIXED: formating note -->
Note that Money Won column is right aligned, and that amateure golfers
as well as disqualified ones
have that column filled with spaces until the right edge of table.
<!-- FIXED: added empty line note -->
At the end of table write empty line to separate distinct tournaments.
Sample output is shown below:
<!-- FIXED: added ruler and ruler note -->
<I>Note: The ruler is written here only for your convenience,
don't write it in output of your program.</I>
<P>
<!-- FIXED: Norman Niblick* and Ben Birdie are tied - marked them such -->
<!-- FIXED: the 3rd place is used for tie, the same applies to 5th place -->
