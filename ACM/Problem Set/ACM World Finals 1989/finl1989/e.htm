The DoD company has contractod to determine under what conditions a pair
of scanner robots can collide. The
robots are fired simultaneously from ``guns&quot; that are mounted near
opposite ends of a horizontal strip.  They travel in
straight lines until they hit a wall of the strip or until they are in
the same spot at the approximately the same time.
<P>
<!-- FIXED: added alt description, renamed image file -->

<P>
Whenever a robot hits a wall, it bounces off without loss of speed
and in a straight line so that the angle of incidence
equals the angle of reflection.
<P>
<!-- FIXED: added alt description, renamed image file -->

<P>
If the robots are in the same spot at approximately the same time, then
they ``collide.&quot;
<P>
<P>
Write a program to determine
whether robots collide and if so where.  To simplify the computer model of
the physical problem, assume the following.

    The horizontal strip is 2-dimensional, and it runs left-to-right. Its
    walls are straight lines.

    Each robot is a point mass. That is, the circumference of each
    robot is 0.

    A robot maintains the speed with which it was originally fired until it
    collides with the other robot or until it
    passes the gun from which the other robot was fired.

    There are 2 guns, one mounted to the left of the other on a horizontal
    strip. The initial angle of the left gun
    <!-- FIXED: changed the alt description and image name -->
    is between -85

    <!-- FIXED: changed the alt description and image name -->
    and 85 <IMG WIDTH=5 HEIGHT=6 ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="degrees" SRC="e3.gif" >

    each other.

<P>
Input for your program is a text file which contains data for several
different pairs of robots.  The lines of the text
file come in pairs.  The first line of a pair gives initial firing information
about the robot fired from the leftmost gun.
The second line of the pair gives initial firing information about the robot
fired from the rightmost gun.  Each line
contains 4 data items as follows:
<P>
<I>x</I>-coordinate <I>y</I>-coordinate angle speed
<P>
<!-- FIXED: changed the note -->
  (all values are real numbers, angle is in degrees)
<P>
The end of input is indicated by end-of-file.  Assume that the input is
error-free.

<P>
<!-- FIXED: changed the accuracy note -->
To help maintain floating point accuracy when converting degrees to
radians, use the predeclared constant <TT>pi</TT>.
<P>
For each robot problem, output from your program should consist of the number
of the problem (ex: <TT>Robot problem #1</TT>, <TT>Robot problem #2</TT>),
<!-- FIXED: added colon -->
colon and a statement indicating whether or not the robots do collide.
If they do collide, your
prograrn should also print the coordinates of the point of collision.
<!-- FIXED: added note about the right point -->
If the robots collide multiple times, write the coordinates of collision
point with shortest passing interval. If there're many of such points,
write the one with lowest x coordinate.
All real output should be printed with 2 digits
to the right of the decimal.
