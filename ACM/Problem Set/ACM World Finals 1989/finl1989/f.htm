<P>
A frustrating part of arranging your own air travel trip is
selecting from among many possible flights that sequence
of flights which will take you from your origin to your
destination in the least possible time or for the least possible
cost.
<P>
<P>
It should be clear to any frequent air passenger that
in order to reach one city from another, the cost of the shorter
flight may be more than the cost of longer flights.
In other words, it may pay you well to cool your heels in an
airport waiting for a connecting flight rather than
take a more direct flight or one in which the connecting time is
shorter.  For example, consider the following flight schedule.
<P>
<PRE>            Center City     Homeville       5:2OA  6:55A  12.50
            Center City     Greenville      5:45A  9:l5A  35.00
            Homeville       Greenville      7:45A  9:35A  20.00</PRE>
<P>
In order to travel from Center City to Greenville, you
have two choices.  You can travel from Center City to
Homeville, then from Homeville to Greenville, or you
can travel directly from Center City to Greenville.  The first
route costs $32.50 and has travel time 4:15;
the direct route costs $35.00 and has travel time 3:30.
If minimizing cost
is your objective, then you would choose the first route.
If you want to minimize time, you would select the second
route.
<P>
<P>
You are to write a program to optimize route selection
given the criteria of least cost or least time.  Your program
will read a list of flights and several trip rcquests
and will select from the list of flights the best sequence to satisfy
each trip request.  For each request, if more than one
route should satisfy the request, then your program should
select the route that also satisfies the other
objective.  For example, if cost is to be minimizad and if two routes both
yield the minimum cost, then select the route which
yields the shortest travel time.  If two routes yield identical costs
and travel times, then select either route.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001001000000000000000">Input</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
The input consists of several blocks.
First line contains number of these blocks.
Every block is broken into two segments, the
first describing the list of flights and the second containing the trip
requests. The end of each segment is
indicated by the line consisting of the single character `<TT>#</TT>'.
<P>
<P>
The flight segment of the file describes individual
flights, one per line.  Each line contains the origin city (columns 1
through 19), the destination city (columns 21 through 39),
the departure time (columns 41 through 46). the arrival
time (columns 48 through 53), and the cost
(columns 55 through 60).  City names are left-justified in their respective
fields, and may contain upper and lower case characters and spaces.
Times are in the form <I>HH</I>:<I>MMX</I>, where <I>HH</I> is the hour (a
leading zero may be replaced by a blank), <I>MM</I> is the
minutes (exactly two digits will appear), and <I>X</I> is <TT>A</TT> (for AM),
<TT>P</TT> (for PM), or <TT>M</TT> or <TT>N</TT> 
(this can be used only after 12:00 to distinguish
midnight from noon). The cost of the ticket is in dollars
and cents, and includes a decimal point and two
fractional digits.  No tickets are free or cost more than $999.99.
No individual flight represented by a line in the schedule takes
more than 24 hours.  There will be at most 20 flights on the schedule.
<P>
<P>
The trip request segment
follows the list of flights.  Each request appears on a line by itself,
and specifies the origin city (columns 1 to 19),
the destination city (columns 21 to 39), and whether to optimize cost
or travel time.  If it is desired to optimize
travel time, the word <TT>TIME</TT> is in columns 41 to 44.  If cost is to be
optimized, then the word <TT>COST</TT> is in columns 41 to 44.
There may be trailing blanks in any line in the flight
schedule or the trip requests.
<P>
<H2><FONT COLOR=#0070E8><A NAME="SECTION0001002000000000000000">Output</A></FONT></H2>
<P>
For each travel request, display the request and the optimal route
in the form shown below.
Notice that trailing spaces are removed from city names.
Time is output in the form &lt;hh&gt;:&lt;mm&gt;,
where &lt;hh&gt; goes from 0 to 23 and &lt;mm&gt;
goes from 0 to 59.
If the trip takes more than one day,
the time output starts with the 
number of days and string "day" appended (or "days"
if the flight takes more than 48 hours).
There are no leading zeroes nor blanks allowed.
<P>
<P>
All optimum routes will
require less than 10 days and less than $1,000.00.
Place exactly one blank line between the outputs for successive trips.
<P>
